In no particular order:


* [jstat](http://jstat.github.io/)
> jStat is a statistical library written in JavaScript that allows you to perform advanced statistical operations without the need of a dedicated statistical language (e.g. MATLAB or R).

* [gauss](https://github.com/wayoutmind/gauss)
> Evented, asynchronous, and fast, Node.js is an attractive platform for data mining, statistics, and data analysis. Gauss makes it easy to calculate and explore data through JavaScript, both on Node.js and within the web browser.

* [sylvester](http://sylvester.jcoglan.com/)
> Sylvester is a vector, matrix and geometry library for JavaScript, that runs in the browser and on the server side. It includes classes for modelling vectors and matrices in any number of dimensions, and for modelling infinite lines and planes in 3-dimensional space. It lets you write object-oriented easy-to-read code that mirrors the maths it represents. For example, it lets you multiply vectors and matrics together:

* [science.js](https://github.com/jasondavies/science.js)
> Science.js is a JavaScript library for scientific and statistical computing.
 Currently, there are two modules:
> * science.stats, containing various implementations of statistical methods similar to those provided by R;
> * science.lin, for linear algebra.

* [bayes.js](https://github.com/rasmusab/bayes.js)
> bayes.js is small toy JavaScript MCMC framework that can be used fit Bayesian models in the browser. I call it "toy" because I would use it for fun, but not in production...
> Implements a MCMC framework which can be used to fit Bayesian model with both discrete and continuous parameters. Currently the only algorithm that is implemented is a version of the adaptive Metropolis within Gibbs (AMWG) algorithm presented by Roberts and Rosenthal (2009) . Loading this file in the browser creates the global object mcmc.
distributions.js - A collection of log density functions that can be used to construct Bayesian models. Follows the naming scheme ld.* (for example, ld.norm and ld.pois) and uses the same parameters as the d* density functions in R. Loading this file in the browser creates the global object ld.
